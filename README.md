# Accident Detection and Recovery Dashboard

This project simulates accident detection and response using AI (YOLO), Python, SQL, and Power BI.

It is inspired by my internship experience at **NHAI**, where as a data analyst I studied road accident patterns and highway safety responses.

### What It Does:
- Detects road accidents using a camera/video
- Classifies accident severity: Minor / Moderate / Severe
- Logs accident data into an SQLite database (with time & location)
- Displays visual dashboard using Power BI (accident trends)

### My Contributions:
- Integrated real-world highway data logic from NHAI
- Added database system to log crashes (SQLite)
- Built Power BI dashboard to analyze accidents by region and time
